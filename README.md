# Golang backend

Backend for the main app.


## Deploy project

### Use Gitpod

There is a .gitpod.yml file that takes care of deployment in this case.
Have the Gitpod extention on your browser:
Any Chromium-based browser: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/gitpod/

Go to the github repo https://github.com/Hvdvyve/reservations-backend-golang and open a Gitpod workspace using the Gitpod extention (green button Gitpod).
Run with command: go run main.go

### Locally

Have Golang 1.16 or higher installed.
*go build
Run with command: go run main.go



Extra info:
All the code we've written is inside of main.go and Reservations/definitions.go
